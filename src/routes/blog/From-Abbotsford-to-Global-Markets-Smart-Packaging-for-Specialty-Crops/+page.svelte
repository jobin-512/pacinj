    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">British Columbia, particularly the Abbotsford region, is home to some of Canada’s most productive specialty crop farms. From berries and mushrooms to niche vegetables, local farmers produce high-quality, delicate crops that require careful handling to reach markets both locally and internationally.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-10">In today’s competitive agriculture landscape, producing quality crops is only part of the challenge. Ensuring that these crops arrive fresh, intact, and visually appealing is equally critical. Smart packaging solutions—such as trays, baskets, and totes from Pacific Injection Molding—are essential for protecting delicate specialty crops while optimizing labor, storage, and transport efficiency.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Role of Packaging in Specialty Crop Success</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Specialty crops are particularly sensitive due to their size, fragility, and perishability. Proper packaging is crucial for several reasons:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Protection from Damage</span>: Delicate produce like mushrooms, berries, and small vegetables can easily be bruised or crushed. Packaging designed to cushion and separate crops prevents losses.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Shelf-Life Extension</span>: Adequate airflow, moisture control, and insulation help extend the freshness of perishable products.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Operational Efficiency</span>: Ergonomically designed trays and baskets facilitate handling, stacking, and transport from field to processing facilities.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Visual Appeal</span>: Attractive packaging communicates quality and professionalism, enhancing marketability and consumer satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">In essence, packaging is not just a container—it is an investment in crop quality, farm profitability, and customer satisfaction.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Pacific Injection Molding Specialty Packaging Products</h2>
