    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">Canada’s dairy industry is a vital component of the country’s agricultural economy. From British Columbia to Ontario, dairy farms supply milk, cream, cheese, and other products to local markets, grocery stores, and export destinations. While farm operations, milking technology, and cold storage often receive attention, one critical factor is frequently overlooked: the role of durable, high-quality milk crates in distribution efficiency and cost savings.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-10">Milk crates are not just containers—they are strategic tools that protect products, improve handling efficiency, and ensure the dairy supply chain operates smoothly. Investing in the right crates can save distributors thousands of dollars in product loss, reduce labor time, and enhance operational sustainability.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Importance of Milk Crates in Dairy Distribution</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Milk crates perform several essential functions in the distribution process:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Product Protection</span>: Glass and plastic bottles are fragile. Durable crates prevent tipping, breakage, and spills during transport and handling.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Stackability</span>: Standardized crates allow for easy stacking in delivery trucks, warehouses, and retail storage areas, maximizing space without compromising safety.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Operational Efficiency</span>: Uniform crate sizes simplify handling, loading, and unloading, saving time and labor costs.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Sustainability</span>: Reusable crates reduce reliance on disposable packaging, lowering environmental impact and disposal costs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">For Canadian distributors, particularly in regions like BC where farms are often smaller and distribution distances can vary widely, crate selection directly impacts operational success.</p>
